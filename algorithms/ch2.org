* Exercise 1 on page 50
** a
*** n
*** addition of two numbers
*** no
** b
*** 1 number (n, the number whose factorial you are computing)
*** multiplication of two numbers
*** yes
** c
*** n
*** comparison of two numbers
*** no

*** 
*** no

* Exercise 8 on page 51
** a - log2(n)
log2(4n/n)
= log2(4n) - log2(n)
= log2(4) + log2(n) - log2(n)
= log2(4)
= 2

** sqrt(n)
sqrt(4n) / sqrt(n)
= sqrt(4)
= 2

** n
4n / n
= 4

** n^2
(4n)^2 / n^2
= 4^2
=16

** n^3
(4n)^3 / n ^ 2
= 4^3
= 64

** 2^n
2^(4n) / 2^n
= 2^3n

* Exercise 3 on page 59
** a - (n^2 + 1)^10
= n^20+10 n^18+45 n^16+120 n^14+210 n^12+252 n^10+210 n^8+120 n^6+45 n^4+10 n^2+1
= Theta(n^20)
** b - sqrt(10n2 + 7n + 3)
= Theta(n)
** d - 2^(n+1)  + 3^(n - 1)
= 2^n

* Exercise 1 on page 67
** a - SUM from 1 to 500 (2i - 1) ... I don't know how to reduce this ...
** b - SUM from 1 to 10 (2^n) ... I don;t know how to reduce this ... 
** c - SUM from 3 to n + 1 (1)
  = SUM from 1 to n - 1 (1)
  = n - 1
** d - SUM from 3 to n + 1 (i)
= SUM from 0 to n + 1 (i) - SUM from 0 to 2 (i)
** e - 

* Exercise 2 on page 67
** a SUM from 0 to n - 1 ((i^2 + 1)^2
= SUM from 0 to n - 1 (i^4 + 2i + 1)
= SUM from 0 to n - 1 (i^4) + SUM from 0 to n-1 (2i^2) + SUM from 0 to n-1 (1)
= Theta(n^5)

** b 
** c

(def fib-seq
   (lazy-cat [0 1] (map + (rest fib-seq) fib-seq)))

** a
(loop [i 1 n (pow 2 31)]
   (if (> (take i fib-seq) n)
      (- 1 i)
      (recur (inc i) n)))
      
** b
(loop [i 1 n (pow 2 63)]
   (if (> (take i fib-seq) n)
      (- 1 i)
      (recur (inc i) n)))
