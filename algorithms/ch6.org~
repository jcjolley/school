We start by placing the coeffecients of the equations into matrix form, and augmenting the matrix with the b values.
Starting Augmented Matrix
1  1  1  2
2  1  1  3
1 -1  1  8

We can then use a series of elementary operations to transform the matrix without changing the relationship between
R2 = R2 - 2R1
1  1  1  2
0 -1 -1 -1
1 -1  1  8

R3 = R3 - R1
1  1  1  2
0 -1 -1 -1
0 -2  0  6

R2 = R3
R3 = R2
1  1  1  2
0 -2  0  6
0 -1 -1 -1

R3 = 1/2R2 + R3
1  1  1  2
0 -2  0  6
0  0 -1  2

We now have an upper triangular matrix that we can sovle using back substitions.
x2 = 2/-1 = -2
x3 = 6/-2 = -3
x1 = -3 + -2 + -2 = -7
