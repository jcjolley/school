* Introduction
I've noticed in my studies that for most topics, I don't understand a particular concept until I have implemented it. 
There is something special about moving from an idea to a result that changes the way I think about
a topic.  Throughout my studies here at BYU-I I've implemented many n^2 (and worse!) algorithms,
and while I've briefly explored orders of growth before, I've never done it as rigorously as this.
I hope my grasp of this grows as fast or faster than the algorithms I'm about to study.

* Specs
/Consider these to be the same for all tests/
Hardware: Intel i5-4670 @ 3.40 GHZ, 8GB Ram
Compiler: GCC 5.3.0 (via cygwin)
Timers: BASH BUILTIN time (via cygwin)
Assumptions: I'm the only user logged in, and I'm running no other processes that are demanding on the CPU.
