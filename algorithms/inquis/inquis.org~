* Introduction
I've noticed in my studies that for most topics, I don't understand a particular concept until I have implemented it. 
There is something special about moving from an idea to a result that changes the way I think about
a topic.  Throughout my studies here at BYU-I I've implemented many n^2 (and worse!) algorithms,
and while I've briefly explored orders of growth before, I've never done it as rigorously as this.
I hope my grasp of this grows as fast or faster than the algorithms I'm about to study.

* Specs
/Consider these to be the same for all tests/
Hardware: Intel i5-4670 @ 3.40 GHZ, 8GB Ram
Compiler: GCC 4.9.0 (via Windows 10 BASH) with -03
Timers: BASH BUILTIN time (via Windows 10 BASH)
Assumptions: I'm the only user logged in, and I'm running no other processes that are demanding on the CPU.
* Part 1
** Some Background
   I implemented a bubble sort and a selection sort.  Each program needs an input size (n) and the number of
times you want the algorithm to run.  Each program then returns the number of times the critical operation
occured.  I then wrote a bash script to exercise these programs, running with an input size that grows by a
power of 10 each iteration, and with the number of runs being decreased by a factor of 10 each time. 

The output and running time of the programs are collected into a table and displayed at the end. I will attempt
to tangle the script and the source code for both programs for your perusal.
** Bash Script
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle 
#!/bin/bash

BUBBLE_TABLE="Bubble Sort: |"
SELECT_TABLE="Select Sort: |"

#Run it more times on the smaller inputs to get a better average
POW=$(bc <<< "$1 - 1")
RUNS=$(bc <<< "10^$POW")

for i in `seq 1 $1`;
do
    #Input ranges from 10 - 1,000,000 
    N=$(bc <<< "10^$i")

    #Time the bubble run and add the results to the bubble table
    TEMP=$(/usr/bin/time ./bubble $N $RUNS 2>&1) 
    TIME=$(echo "$TEMP" | awk -v RS="" {'print $2'})
    CRIT_OPS=$(echo "$TEMP" | awk -v RS="" {'print $1'})
    BUBBLE_TABLE="$BUBBLE_TABLE OPS:$CRIT_OPS TIME:$TIME RUNS:$RUNS | "

    #Time the select run and add the results to the select table
    TEMP=$(/usr/bin/time ./selection $N $RUNS 2>&1)
    TIME=$(echo "$TEMP" | awk -v RS="" {'print $2'})
    CRIT_OPS=$(echo "$TEMP" | awk -v RS="" {'print $1'})
    SELECT_TABLE="$SELECT_TABLE OPS:$CRIT_OPS TIME:$TIME RUNS:$RUNS | "

    #This prevents us from running less than once for the big ones.
    echo "Runs: $RUNS"
    if [ $RUNS -gt 1 ]
    then
	RUNS=$(bc <<< "$RUNS/10")
    fi
