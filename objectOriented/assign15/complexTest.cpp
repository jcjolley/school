* Program:
*    Assignment 15, Separate Compilation
*    Brother Helfrich, CS165
* Author:
*    Joshua Jolley
* Summary: 
*    This program is designed to perform very simple manipulations of
*    Complex numbers.  A complex number, as you may recall, is a two
*    part number with a real and imagionary part.
*
*    Your assigment here is to break this file into four parts:
*       complex.h        Header file with data types and prototypes
*       complex.cpp      All the functions manipulating complex numbers
*       complexTest.cpp  Driver program exercising the complex type.
*       makefile         File describing how to build this project
*
*    Estimated:  1.0 hrs   
*    Actual:     1.0 hrs
*      Just wrapping my head around the whole concept... as soon
*      as I figured out what I was doing it all came together.
